# C# Algorithms and Patterns
A collection of common algorithms and patterns useful to have on hand

The point of this repo is for me to get more acquainted with different design patterns and algorithms. It also (hopefully) will make me commit to GitHub more often, a habit I need to acquire.

I wanted to remove any reliance on StackOverflow or other resources for grabbing these scripts. Especially when I can create my own library to pull from with my own notes and quirks.
