//In C# there are tons of options for the classes of your objects, but what if you need it to be nothing? 
// Or what if you need to have an object, with a few properties, but you're only going to need it right now
// and don't want to build a class around it? That's where Anonymous classes and Nullable types come in. 

//Anonymous Classes
//These allow us to declare an object, with no determined class, and have it contain data
//Below we create an anonymous object, and then give it some properties
var myAnonymousObject = new {Name = "John Smith", Age = 27, Gender="M", FavoriteColor = "Red"};
//Then we can query those properties just like any other object
Console.WriteLine($"Your object's name is {myAnonymousObject.Name} and it's {myAnonymousObject.Age}")
Console.WriteLine($"It is a {myAnonymousObject.Gender} and its' favorite color is {myAnonymousObject.FavoriteColor}")


//Nullable Types
//Nullable types allow us to not give a value to a variable. This helps initialize a given variable, and it helps
// when checking against the variable for certain logic. 
int? myInt = null;
