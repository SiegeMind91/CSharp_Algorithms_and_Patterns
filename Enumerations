//Enumerations in C# allow us to utilize a static list of constants multiple times without having to create multiple lists.
//They allow us to create categories of things and then place values inside those categories that we'll use again and again
//Enumerations are value types and are stored on the stack, rather than on the heap

//As you can see below, each item is also assigned an integer value
//You can use either value when coding, and they always start at 0
enum Season
{
    Spring, //0 
    Summer, //1
    Autumn, //2
    Winter  //3
}

//Enums are perfect for lists of things that won't change, like seasons or months or even the face of playing cards.
